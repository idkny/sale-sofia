## Bulgarian Construction Permits Reference

| Document | Bulgarian | What It Means | Acceptable? |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Act 14 | Акт 14 | Rough construction complete | NO |
| Act 15 | Акт 15 | Construction finished, awaiting inspection | YES (minimum) |

**Key questions for new builds:**

## Bulgarian Sqm Note

**IMPORTANT**: In Bulgaria, advertised sqm often includes:

- Elevator space
- External walls
- Sometimes even percentage of basement

**Always ask:**
- "Каква е чистата площ?" (What is the net/clean area?)
- "Това с общите части ли е?" (Does this include common areas?)

**Rule**: If listing says 110-120 sqm WITH shared = likely ~80-95 sqm actual
