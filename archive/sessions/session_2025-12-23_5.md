# Session 5 - 2025-12-23
**Focus:** Project restructure & database setup

- Fixed setup.sh: removed pyenv remnant, fixed pre-commit for non-git project
- Restructured project: merged `scraper/` into root (flat structure), removed git configs
- Created new venv, ran full setup (camoufox, mubeng, fingerprint-chromium installed)
- Created `agencies` table in SQLite with relation to `listings` (agency_id FK)
- Built `data/agency_store.py` utility, imported 6 agencies from markdown
- Built proxy-scraper-checker (Rust) - works but needs to run from its directory
- Next: Test scraper, implement imot.bg scraper
