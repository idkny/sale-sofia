## Session 7 - 2025-12-23
**Focus:** imot.bg scraper implementation

- Implemented `websites/imot_bg/scraper.py` with full extraction logic (price, sqm, floor, features)
- Added pagination support to `main.py` - crawls multiple search pages
- Updated rate limiting: 10 URLs/min (6 sec delay between requests)
- Created `celery_app.py` for background proxy tasks (Redis broker)
- Analyzed imot.bg HTML structure: search URL pattern, listing selectors, pagination (`/p-N`)
