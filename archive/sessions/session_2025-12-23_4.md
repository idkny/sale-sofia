## Session 4 - 2025-12-23
**Focus:** Scraper cleanup & simplification

- Fixed proxy checker to filter out Transparent proxies (level 1 doesn't hide IP)
- Created `/ltst` command for live testing with background output + timestamped logs
- Cleaned requirements.txt: removed 11 packages (serpapi, duckduckgo, langchain, torch, streamlit, etc.)
- Removed browser-use and personal browser code (my_local.py, my_browser_connector.py)
- Cleaned .env, browsers/utils.py, cleared all old logs for fresh start
- Next: Set up virtualenv and test scraper
