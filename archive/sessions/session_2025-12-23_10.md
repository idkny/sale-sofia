## Session 10 - 2025-12-23
**Focus:** Proxy system orchestration investigation

### Investigation Completed
- Analyzed 4 repos: Scraper, AutoBiz, Competitor-Intel, sale-sofia
- Mapped HOW tools work together (not just what each does)
- Documented data flow, timing, wait mechanisms

### Key Orchestration Findings

| Repo | Pattern | Strength | Weakness |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| Scraper | Sequential + sleep(10) | Simple | No completion detection |
| AutoBiz | Empty (skeleton) | N/A | Not implemented |
| Competitor-Intel | asyncio.gather + scoring | Parallel + adaptive | No persistence |
| sale-sofia | Celery + file mtime | Task queue | Fragile sync |

### Gaps Identified in sale-sofia
1. **Fire-and-forget auto-trigger** - `check.delay()` might not run
2. **Beat schedule conflicts** - Check task runs independently of scrape
3. **No task result validation** - Tasks return strings, never checked
4. **No progress reporting** - User waits 10 min with no feedback
5. **All-or-nothing recovery** - Pre-flight failure triggers full refresh

### Files Created/Updated
- `docs/PROXY_SYSTEM_SPECS.md` - Added Section 10: Orchestration Analysis
- `docs/PROXY_SYSTEM_TASKS.md` - Added Phase 0: Orchestration Fixes (priority tasks)
